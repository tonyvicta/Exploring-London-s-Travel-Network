# Exploring Londons Travel Network


## Project Overview
Transport for London (TfL) is one of the most extensive public transportation networks in the world, serving over 1.5 million journeys daily across a variety of transport modes, including buses, trains, cable cars, and the Underground. This project focuses on analysing TfL’s journey data from 2010 to 2022, stored in a Snowflake database, to uncover insights into the travel behaviors of Londoners and identify trends and anomalies in transport usage.

By leveraging SQL and data analysis techniques, this project explores critical questions such as:

- What are the most popular transport methods in London?
- When did the London cable car experience peak usage, and what factors influenced this?
- What were the rare occasions when the London Underground had unusually low activity, and what could explain them?

Through this analysis, the project provides actionable insights into transport trends, highlighting how data can inform decisions for urban planning, transport management, and future infrastructure improvements.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyse TfL journey data to achieve the following:

1. Identify Popular Transport Methods:
Understand which modes of transport are most commonly used by Londoners and how these preferences have evolved over time.

2. Analyze Cable Car Usage:
Investigate the factors contributing to peak usage periods of the London cable car, with a focus on its connection to events and specific timeframes.

3. Explore Underground Anomalies:
Detect rare periods of reduced activity on the London Underground and uncover potential causes, such as seasonal patterns, events, or external disruptions.

4. Showcase Analytical Skills:
Demonstrate the ability to write efficient SQL queries, analyze large datasets, and provide meaningful insights through clear reporting and visualization.

5. Inform Future Planning:
Offer insights that could be valuable for TfL’s decision-making, particularly in areas such as capacity planning, event management, and improving service reliability.

This project aims to showcase not only technical proficiency in data analysis but also a strong understanding of practical, real-world applications for transportation and urban development.
